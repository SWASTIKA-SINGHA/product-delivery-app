# üõí FastKart - Complete E-Commerce Website

## üìù What I Did - Simple Explanation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Added Razorpay Payment Gateway
**What it does:** When you choose "Online Payment", a professional payment window opens where customers can pay using UPI, Cards, Net Banking, etc.

**How it works:**
- Added Razorpay script in the HTML head
- Your Test API Keys are used: `rzp_test_RPKqAiU4LBTA7T`
- When user clicks "Place Order" with Online Payment selected:
  1. First, it validates all form fields (name, email, phone, address)
  2. Then opens Razorpay payment popup
  3. Customer enters payment details
  4. After successful payment, order is saved
  5. If payment fails/cancelled, order is NOT placed

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Added Customer Information Fields
**New fields added:**
- Full Name (required)
- Email Address (required)
- Phone Number (required)
- Delivery Address (required)

All fields are validated before placing order.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Added Delivery Options
**Three delivery speeds:**
- Standard Delivery (3-5 days) - FREE
- Express Delivery (1-2 days) - ‚Çπ50 extra
- Same Day Delivery - ‚Çπ100 extra

The delivery charge automatically updates the total price.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Order Summary
**Shows:**
- Number of items
- Subtotal (items cost)
- Delivery charge (changes based on delivery option)
- Final Total (Subtotal + Delivery)

Updates in real-time when you change delivery option.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Two Payment Methods
**Cash on Delivery (COD):**
- Order placed immediately
- Payment status: "Pending"
- Pay when delivery arrives

**Online Payment (Razorpay):**
- Razorpay popup opens
- Must complete payment first
- Only after successful payment, order is placed
- Payment status: "Paid"
- Shows Payment ID in confirmation

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Order Confirmation
**After placing order, shows:**
- Order ID
- Customer details (name, email, phone)
- Items ordered count
- Subtotal
- Delivery charge
- Total amount
- Payment method and status
- Payment ID (for online payments)
- Delivery type
- Delivery address
- Estimated delivery date
- Confirmation message

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Order History
**Shows all past orders with:**
