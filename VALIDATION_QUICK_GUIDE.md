## 📊 Validation Code Explained

```javascript
// Email validation function
function isValidEmail(email) {
  const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}

What it checks:
- [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+ → Username part (letters, numbers, dots, etc.)
- @ → Required @ symbol
- [a-zA-Z0-9.-]+ → Domain name
- \. → Required dot
- [a-zA-Z]{2,}$ → Extension (com, in, co.uk, etc.)
```

```javascript
// Phone validation function
function isValidPhone(phone) {
  const phoneRegex = /^[0-9]{10}$/;
  return phoneRegex.test(phone);
}

What it checks:
- ^[0-9]{10}$ → Exactly 10 digits, nothing else
```

```javascript
// Name validation function
function isValidName(name) {
  const nameRegex = /^[A-Za-z\s]{3,50}$/;
  return nameRegex.test(name);
}

What it checks:
- ^[A-Za-z\s]{3,50}$ → 3-50 characters, letters and spaces only
```
